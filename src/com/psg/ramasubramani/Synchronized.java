//Runnable Targets are Tasks. Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable()	{}); --> Attach
//a task to a thread for execution.
	
//When multiple tasks(threads) try to access the shared resource, 
//the access should be serialized, means several tasks should not
//access the shared resource at the same time, for example when one thread is reading a file, 
//another thread should not write into the file.
//If it happens simultaneously, reading thread will not get the proper object(file).
//Let the writing thread finishes first and next the reading thread can pick up the recent file
//So, in case of shared resources , the critical section should be handled by mutex(mutual exclusion)
//Piece of code - mutex (print, type)- only one thread can execute it on the same object at any time, 
//until the thread completes its critical section other threads have to wait.
	
	
//In the following case print() is called on the same object printwriter(). Since the method 
//is synchronized the critical section(print method)
//can't be executed by T1,T2 simultaneously. T2 can execute print() method only when T1 finishes it. 
//Once T1 enters print method, 
//the object locks all the synchronized instance methods, 
//so any other thread cannot execute any synchronized methods(print(),type()) on the same NumberWriter object.
//If you try to call print method on different NumberWriter object, then both threads will run simultaneously, 
//because lock is for an object(one lock per object) example T3,T4 runs simultaneously.

		t2.start();
		
		//T3 T4 runs simultaneously, because the method is locked by numberPrinter3 
		//when T3 executes the print method on numberPrinter3. 
		//so, this time if you try to call print or type() method on numberPrinter3 
		//by some other thread you can't
		//But here we are calling on numberPrinter4, so methods are not locked for numberPrinter4 when T3 executes,
		//so both threads execute the method simultaneously,after this both numberPrinter3 and 
		//numberPrinter4 both are locked.
		//so no other thread cannot execute print or type (synchronized methods) on numberPrinter3,
		//numberPrinter4 until they finish their execution
		//Assume runnable target is 'x' and runnable class is 'X'(x is of type X). Assume 
		//there are two synchronized functions type() and print() in class X.
		//run() calls type() first and print() next. You have t1, t2 threads. 
		//Attach the task with t1 and start the thread, (ie) for t1,runnable target is x.
		//now object 'x' is locked, so,if you attach the task t2 with the same object x, 
		//t2 cannot execute type() and print() methods, but only object x is locked.
		//If you create some other object of class X, and if you assign it to t2 you can call. 
		//When one thread locks the object(runnable target), 
		//none of the synchronized methods can be called on the same object until it finishes its execution.
		//When one thread enters critical section it acquires the lock of the calling object(runnable target).
		//Even though other threads cannot enter
		//the critical section on the same object, the thread which has the lock can enter into any number 
		//of critical sections
		//(can execute any number of synchronous methods nestedly)
		//each time it calls synchronous method count is increased by 1 and whenever it leaves the method, 
		//the count is decremented by 1, so when the thread comes out of all synchronized methods,
		//count becomes 0 and the thread releases the lock.
