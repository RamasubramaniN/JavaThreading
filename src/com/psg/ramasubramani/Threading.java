///It is very difficult to increase the clock rates of computers because it will have effect on heat, so system parts will degrade
///So, it is better to have more processors than increasing clock rates, if multiple processors are there there are advantages.
///1)speed - if you have 3 processes, and 4 processors, assign one process to each processor, each processor will execute process simultaneously, 
//in this case speed is increased by n times.
///This is called multi-processing. Executing multiple programs simultaneously, this can be achieved by having multiple processors.
//2)Fairness, modern computers allow multiple users accessing the same system, 
//so they have equal claims on resources, each user may run a single long running program
//assume 10 users logged in and each user executes a process, to these processes are shared across 5 processors.  

//Single processor handling multiple processes - not multi processing, this is called multi tasking.
//(multi processing means, at the same time multiple processes should get executed.) 
//Because at any point in time, only one process is executed in this case, each process gets CPU handle for sometime,
// executes the program and then CPU handle is given to some other process (context switching).
//Multi Threading - Within a process divide the program into independent or almost independent tasks and assign the tasks to threads. 
//Since they execute inside the same process, they share the same processor memory.So,they will share heap space and resources, 
//need to synchronise when multiple threads modify a shared resource.
//(Ex) In servlet request handling Servlet Context is shared resource across the requests, need to synchronize it.
//When to use threading, assume you have single processor, you have single program to execute, 
//you divided the program into multiple tasks and inside the tasks if some tasks need to wait for some input from the user,
//good to have multi threading. But inside in none of the individual tasks, no blocking time means no use to have multi threading.
//Because the intention is when one sub task waits another sub task can execute since they are independent, 
//but in the above case, since there are no blocking issue, no need to use threading , no need to split the tasks into sub tasks,
//we could run it sequentially.
//But in the above case,if multiple processors or multi core processors are available, then we can divide it into sub tasks,
//because we can assign each sub task to each processor and more than one task will be executed at any point in time.
//So, the idea is either you have to have a blocking thing in any one of the sub task or you need to have multiple processes.
//Multi core processor - (example) dual core, it has two separate processors inside, so it can execute two processes at the same time,
//each processor each process, quad core, 4 processors.
//8085 Von Newmann architecture, program and data memory is shared,amount 16 address lines, 8 lines have been shared for data lines. 
//8051 Havard architecture, separate program and data memory, separate address and data lines,
//so it is a bit faster than 8085 because data and program instructions can be fetched simultaneously since they are separate.

//Threads are everywhere, even if you dont create a thread,the framework may create threads.gc runs as a thread, main is a thread, 
//thread is used in remote method invocation (Asynchronous call).servlets request handling uses threads for each request, 
//UI event handling uses fixed thread pool to increase responsiveness of the application.
//Housekeeping tasks(garbage collection,finalisation) are executed by the threads created by JVM

//Stateless objects are always thread safe, because object's state is defined by its member variables, 
//so, here the state will not be damaged at any point of time.
//The class which has only final(cannot recreate using new operator) immutable(object members cannot be edited) fields are also thread safe.
//Better you encapsulate your fields better thread safety you will get as result

//atomic operation is a indivisible operation, when one thread executes atomic operation, 
//no other threads can execute the same operation(routine) until the thread completes the atomic operation.
//when you use normal variables in your class x++ will execute as 3 instructions, so, thread safety is not ensured.
//If you use atomic variables the above x++ will be an indivisible operation,but if you have two atomic variables 
//and both should be updated to maintain proper state of object,thread safety is not ensured, 
//because individual atomic variable operation is indivisible, but there is a possible way after updating atomic 1, 
//some other thread gets CPU handle and updates atomic 2, and then atomic 2 is modified by first thread.
//So, all the related operations should be performed as indivisible operations.

//When we use synchronised method, the method is locked by the intrinsic lock of the object(the instance which called the intrinsic object). 
//Note, only this routine is locked and not the object is locked means, no other method can call the method on the same object until the object 
//finishes its routines(but the method can be called on some other object).
//So, only the routines are locked, member variables of the particular object are not locked, the object's member variables can be 
//modified by some other part of the application when synchronised method is executing. Only one lock per object, 
//so, make sure the same lock should be used to protect all the member variables 


//You have a long running task and a timer, timer triggers a separate thread to get the snapshot of the entire program 
//(If the program crashes no need to start from the beginning, just use the snapshot and resume from there.)
//The problem is when getting snapshot you may need to get the value of objects or variables,but the task is progressing and object's 
//state keep changing, so there is a possibility that you do not get the most recent values of some variables,possibly you will get corrupted data.
//so lock the complete object and save the snapshot
