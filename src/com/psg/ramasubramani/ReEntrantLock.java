		//When we use synchronized method or synchronized block, if exception is thrown during

		//When we use synchronized keyword it blocks the calling thread infinitely, no time limit.
		//i.e. Calling a synchronized method is a blocking call, Calling thread waits/blocks
		//indefinitely until it gets monitor.
		//But using explicit lock we can wait and try to acquire the lock for certain period time. 
		//If thread is not able to acquire monitor,
		//don't wait, thread can continue with other things. no blocking here.

/**

main difference between synchronized and ReentrantLock is ability to trying for 
lock interruptibly, and with timeout. 
Thread doesn't need to block infinitely, which was the case with synchronized

1) Significant difference between ReentrantLock and synchronized keyword is fairness. 
synchronized keyword doesn't support fairness. 
 Any thread can acquire lock once released, no preference can be specified, on the 
 other hand you can make ReentrantLock fair by specifying fairness 
 property, while creating instance of ReentrantLock. Fairness property provides lock 
 to longest waiting thread, in case of contention. This solves Starvation issue.

2) Second difference between synchronized and Reentrant lock is tryLock() method. 
ReentrantLock provides convenient tryLock() method, which acquires 
lock only if its available or not held by any other thread. This reduce blocking of 
thread waiting for lock in Java application.

3) One more worth noting difference between ReentrantLock and synchronized keyword 
in Java is, ability to interrupt Thread while waiting for Lock. 
In case of synchronized keyword, a thread can be blocked waiting for lock, for an 
indefinite period of time and there was no way to control that. 
ReentrantLock provides a method called lockInterruptibly(), which can be used to interrupt 
thread when it is waiting for lock. Similarly tryLock() 
with timeout can be used to timeout if lock is not available in certain time period.

4) ReentrantLock also provides convenient method to get List of all threads waiting for lock.
